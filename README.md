Purpose of charging station?

An electric vehicle charging station is equipment that connects an electric vehicle (EV) to a source of electricity to recharge electric cars, 
neighborhood electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids.

Charging stations are also called electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) and are provided in municipal parking locations by electric utility 
companies or at retail shopping centers by private companies. These stations provide special connectors that conform to the variety of electric charging connector standards.

Different types of EVSE provide different speeds of charging. 

1 charging stations use a 120 volt (V), alternating-current (AC) plug and require a dedicated circuit, offering about 5 miles of range for every hour of charging.
2 stations charge through a 240V, AC plug and require home charging or public charging equipment to be installed. Level 2 stations provide 10 to 20 miles of range for every hour of charging. 
Level 2 chargers are the most common and charge at approximately the same rate as a home system.
Level 3 chargers are also known as DC fast chargers. Level 3 uses a 480V, direct-current (DC) plug. They bypass the onboard charger and provide DC electricity to the battery via a special charging port. 
DC Fast Chargers provide up to 40 miles of range for every 10 minutes of charging but are not compatible with all vehicles. Additionally, some propriety charging stations, such as the Tesla Supercharger, are designed for significantly higher-speed charging.
